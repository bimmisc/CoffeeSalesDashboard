<h1> Microsoft Excel Pivot Table and Dashboard Practice Project</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>

This practice project was created by referencing a YouTuber, Mo Chen, who showed how to create visualizations and dashboards in Excel. This project involved data processing, data cleaning, data visualization, and creating a dashboard with slicers and charts using Microsoft Excel This <br />

<h2>Data Analysis Program Used </h2>

- <b>Microsoft Excel</b>


<h2>Findings</h2>


<b> 1) The first step in the analysis step was to find out the number of rides taken by Casual riders and Members. Figure 1 shows Members generated a higher number of rides than Casuals, especially on weekdays. And Members had higher usage on weekdays, which may be used for daily commutes to and from work.
However, on weekends, more rides were logged by Casual riders compared to members. This could be because of more visitors visiting the city on weekends. <b> <br/>

2) The data was then analyzed for average ride durations logged by Casual riders and Members. Figure 2 shows Members had lower average ride durations Casual riders, but more often. The figure also shows Casual riders had longer ride durations on weekends than on weekdays, and this could be because they were visiting the city and used the bike for sightseeing. <br/>

3) I also looked at the number of rides (3a) and average ride duration (3b) by month taken by Casual and Member riders. The overall trend shows that more rides were made in the Summer months, May to October, by both Casual and Member riders. Furthermore, higher average durations were logged from April to July. However, this trend did not coincide with the trend for the number of rides. <br/>

<br />
Lastly, I analyzed the data according to the type of bike used: how often and for how long. Figure  4a) show more Casual riders rented more electric bikes than casual bikes, while Member rides used both types of bikes relatively equally. Despite the higher usage of electric bikes, they were used for shorter durations than classic bikes. One of the reasons for this could be because of the higher price of renting electric bikes. <br/>

The descriptive analysis for ride length was also calculated, as shown in the table below. Casual riders had longer average ride length than Member riders. Casual riders <br/>
